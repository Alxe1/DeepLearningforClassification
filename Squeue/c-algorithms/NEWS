v1.2.0   (14th September 2008)

   * The license has been changed to the ISC license.
   * Support for compiling with gcc coverage options and running tests in
     valgrind.
   * All headers now have extern "C" definitions for use in C++ programs.
   * Trie free function uses a non-recursive algorithm to avoid the
     possibility of stack overflow.

  Test suite:
   * Framework added for testing memory allocation/free.
   * Tests have been fixed to properly free any memory allocated during
     execution of the test.
   * Tests have been expanded to increase the code coverage.
   * A test case has been added for testing use of the program in C++
     programs.

  Bugs fixed:
   * Memory leak in hash table.
   * Bugs with the AVL tree.
   * Trie responds to out of memory scenarios correctly.

v1.1.0   (1st June 2008)

  * Added data structures:
     - Binary Heap
     - Binomial Heap
     - Bloom Filter
  * Iterator functions changed to a model based around an iterator structure
    rather than callback functions.
  * Void pointers used for keys/values replaced by typedefs to void pointers.
    This allows the type to be changed to something else if desired.
  * Hash table sizes changed to use a set of recommended prime numbers
    that are mathematically good for use in hash tables:

  * Tests added for some code that was not covered by the test suite.
  * Failed malloc() calls are now checked for.
  * Bugs fixed:
    - Lockup with set_remove function.
    - set_to_array did not include all values.
